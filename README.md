## Quick Start

### Development Build (Required)

This app uses native modules that require a development build (not Expo Go).

```bash
npm install
npx expo run:android  # For Android
npx expo run:ios      # For iOS (Mac only)
```

See [DEVELOPMENT_BUILD.md](./DEVELOPMENT_BUILD.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Building Standalone Release

For a production build that runs independently:

```bash
# Using EAS (cloud build)
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build --profile production --platform android

# Or build locally
npx expo export --platform android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

See [BUILD_RELEASE.md](./BUILD_RELEASE.md) for details.

## Important: Android Setup

For notifications to work when the app is closed:

1. **Grant notification permissions** when prompted
2. **Disable battery optimization:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí app-that-makes-slack-notification-sound
   - Battery ‚Üí Battery Optimization ‚Üí Select "Not optimized"

The app will prompt you to open these settings on first launch.

## Sound File

The app uses `assets/slack_notification.mp3`. Replace this file with your own MP3 if needed.
